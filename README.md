## 📝 Project Overview
The Exhibition Curation Platform is a dynamic full-stack web application designed to transform how users interact with museum exhibitions. By leveraging modern web technologies, this platform provides an intuitive interface for exploring and curating museum collections from multiple institutions.

### Project Status Note
The backend implementation is currently limited to account setup infrastructure without active functionality. The sorting mechanisms for different museums have been intentionally implemented using varied methods to demonstrate different approaches suitable for their respective API data structures.

## ✨ Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Museum Data Integration**: Fetches and displays exhibition data from multiple museum APIs
- **Dynamic Filtering System**: Filter exhibitions by various topics and categories
- **Custom Curation Tools**: Create and manage personal exhibition collections
- **Multi-Museum Support**: Access content from different museums with unified interface
- **Diverse Sorting Methods**: Implementation of different sorting algorithms tailored to each museum's data structure

### User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices from mobile to desktop
- **Interactive Components**: Smooth, intuitive user interactions
- **Material Design**: Modern, clean aesthetic using Material-UI
- **Accessible Navigation**: Clear, user-friendly layout and menu structure

### Authentication System (Infrastructure Only)
- User registration framework
- Login system structure
- Account management setup
- *Note: Currently non-functional - prepared for future implementation*
